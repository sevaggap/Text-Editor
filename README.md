## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also uses an IndexedDB database to get and store data. Users can input text and it is saved in the IndexedDB database when editor loses focus. The data persists when the page is loaded and re-populates the text editor so you can pick up where you left off!
